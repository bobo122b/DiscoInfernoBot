# Training-Bot
this is my discord bot, I keep editing on it from time to time.

You can add this bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=941782025210327091&permissions=534790012358&scope=bot)

## Banned Words
you can add banned words as much as you want included in your server.

```python
banned_words = ["banned 1", "banned 2"]
```

## keywords
there are several words here that are used as keywords for the bot.

| keyword | action |
| ------- | ------ |
| $yt | searches for whatever comes after it on youtube and sends the first video in the youtube search |
